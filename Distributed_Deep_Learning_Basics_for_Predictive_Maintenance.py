# # Deep Learning for Predictive Maintenance
# 
# Deep learning has proven to show superior performance in certain domains such as object recognition and image classification. It has also gained popularity in  domains such as finance where time-series data plays an important role. Predictive Maintenance is also a domain where data is collected over time to monitor the state of an asset with the goal of finding patterns to predict failures which can also benefit from certain deep learning algorithms. Among the deep learning methods, Long Short Term Memory [(LSTM)](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) networks are especially appealing to the predictive maintenance domain due to the fact that they are very good at learning from sequences. This fact lends itself to their applications using time series data by making it possible to look back for longer periods of time to detect failure patterns. In this notebook, we build an LSTM network for the data set and scenerio described at [Predictive Maintenance Template](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/Collection/Predictive-Maintenance-Template-3) to predict remaining useful life of aircraft engines. In summary, the template uses simulated aircraft sensor values to predict when an aircraft engine will fail in the future so that maintenance can be planned in advance. 
# 
# This notebook serves as a tutorial for beginners looking to apply deep learning in predictive maintenance domain and uses a simple scenario where only one data source (sensor values) is used to make predictions. In more advanced predictive maintenance scenarios such as in [Predictive Maintenance Modelling Guide](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/Notebook/Predictive-Maintenance-Modelling-Guide-R-Notebook-1), there are many other data sources (i.e. historical maintenance records, error logs, machine and operator features etc.) which may require different types of treatments to be used in the deep learning networks. Since predictive maintenance is not a typical domain for deep learning, its application is an open area of research. 
# 
# This notebook uses [keras](https://keras.io/) deep learning library with Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit [CNTK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/Using-CNTK-with-Keras) as backend.

# ## Data Ingestion
# In the following section, we ingest the training, test and ground truth datasets from azure storage. The training data consists of multiple multivariate time series with "cycle" as the time unit, together with 21 sensor readings for each cycle. Each time series can be assumed as being generated from a different engine of the same type. The testing data has the same data schema as the training data. The only difference is that the data does not indicate when the failure occurs. Finally, the ground truth data provides the number of remaining working cycles for the engines in the testing data. You can find more details about the type of data used for this notebook at [Predictive Maintenance Template](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/Collection/Predictive-Maintenance-Template-3).

# ## Data Preprocessing
# First step is to generate labels for the training data which are Remaining Useful Life (RUL), label1 and label2 as was done in the [Predictive Maintenance Template](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/Collection/Predictive-Maintenance-Template-3). Here, we will only make use of "label1" for binary clasification, while trying to answer the question: is a specific engine going to fail within w1 cycles?

# In[8]:


# Data Labeling - generate column RUL
rul = pd.DataFrame(train_df.groupby('id')['cycle'].max()).reset_index()
rul.columns = ['id', 'max']
train_df = train_df.merge(rul, on=['id'], how='left')
train_df['RUL'] = train_df['max'] - train_df['cycle']

train_df['label2'] = train_df['label1']
train_df.loc[train_df['RUL'] <= w0, 'label2'] = 2
train_df.head()


# In the [Predictive Maintenance Template](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/Collection/Predictive-Maintenance-Template-3) , cycle column is also used for training so we will also include the cycle column. Here, we normalize the columns in the training data.

# In[10]:

train_df = join_df.reindex(columns = train_df.columns)
train_df.head()


# Next, we prepare the test data. We first normalize the test data using the parameters from the MinMax normalization applied on the training data. 

# In[11]:


test_df['cycle_norm'] = test_df['cycle']

test_join_df = test_df[test_df.columns.difference(cols_normalize)].join(norm_test_df)
test_df = test_join_df.reindex(columns = test_df.columns)
test_df = test_df.reset_index(drop=True)
test_df.head()


# Next, we use the ground truth dataset to generate labels for the test data.

# In[12]:


# generate column max for test data
rul = pd.DataFrame(test_df.groupby('id')['cycle'].max()).reset_index()
rul.columns = ['id', 'max']
truth_df.columns = ['more']
truth_df['id'] = truth_df.index + 1
truth_df['max'] = rul['max'] + truth_df['more']
truth_df.drop('more', axis=1, inplace=True)


# In[13]:


# generate RUL for test data
test_df = test_df.merge(truth_df, on=['id'], how='left')

# In the rest of the notebook, we train an LSTM network that we will compare to the results in [Predictive Maintenance Template Step 2B of 3](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/Experiment/Predictive-Maintenance-Step-2B-of-3-train-and-evaluate-binary-classification-models-2) where a series of machine learning models are used to train and evaluate the binary classification model that uses column "label1" as the label.

# ## Modelling
# 
# The traditional predictive maintenance machine learning models are based on feature engineering which is manual construction of right features using domain expertise and similar methods. This usually makes these models hard to reuse since feature engineering is specific to the problem scenario and the available data which varies from one business to the other. Perhaps the most attractive part of applying deep learning in the predictive maintenance domain is the fact that these networks can automatically extract the right features from the data, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering.
# 
# When using LSTMs in the time-series domain, one important parameter to pick is the sequence length which is the window for LSTMs to look back. This may be viewed as similar to picking window_size = 5 cycles for calculating the rolling features in the [Predictive Maintenance Template](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/Collection/Predictive-Maintenance-Template-3) which are rolling mean and rolling standard deviation for 21 sensor values. The idea of using LSTMs is to let the model extract abstract features out of the sequence of sensor values in the window rather than engineering those manually. The expectation is that if there is a pattern in these sensor values within the window prior to failure, the pattern should be encoded by the LSTM.
# 
# One critical advantage of LSTMs is their ability to remember from long-term sequences (window sizes) which is hard to achieve by traditional feature engineering. For example, computing rolling averages over a window size of 50 cycles may lead to loss of information due to smoothing and abstracting of values over such a long period, instead, using all 50 values as input may provide better results. While feature engineering over large window sizes may not make sense, LSTMs are able to use larger window sizes and use all the information in the window as input. Below, we illustrate the approach.
# 

# In[15]:


# pick a large window size of 50 cycles
sequence_length = 50


# Let's first look at an example of the sensor values 50 cycles prior to the failure for engine id 3. We will be feeding LSTM network this type of data for each time step for each engine id. 

# In[16]:


# preparing data for visualizations
